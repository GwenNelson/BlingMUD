# BlingMUD Agent Instructions

This repository is collaborative space for humans and agents.

Follow these rules when working here:

- Always begin by reviewing what is already in place, what still needs doing, and what known bugs exist.
- Never assume something is implemented until you have verified it in the codebase.
- Always fix known bugs first unless explicitly told not to.
- Always review for potential bugs, including security issues, before starting new feature work.
- Do not patch blindly from assumptions.
- After any implementation or bugfix commit, update `AI_ROADMAP.md` and `TODO.md` before moving on.
- Do not leave the roadmap or TODO stale; future agents rely on them to know what is actually done.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes over large rewrites.
- Keep content work, engine work, and AI architecture work separate where possible.
- Preserve unrelated user changes unless the user asks otherwise.
- Do not revert user work just because it looks incomplete.
- Use `apply_patch` for file edits.
- Do not use destructive commands unless the user explicitly authorizes them.

Repository documents:

- `AI_ROADMAP.md` is the agent-facing long-form implementation plan.
- `TODO.md` is the human-dev patch list for smaller, reviewable changes.
- Keep `AI_ROADMAP.md` current when the implementation changes in meaningful ways.
- Keep `TODO.md` focused on patchable work and bug fixes.

Workflow expectations:

- For bug fixes, start with the bug and its nearest surrounding behavior, then add regression coverage if practical.
- For feature work, check `AI_ROADMAP.md` first so the implementation matches the intended architecture.
- For AI, NPC, persistence, and room-scheduling changes, review the roadmap before making code changes.
- For any new significant subsystem, document the decision in `AI_ROADMAP.md` and keep `TODO.md` aligned at a higher level.
- When a change lands, reconcile all three docs: `AI_ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, and this file.

Project-specific guidance:

- Preserve the distinction between real implemented behavior and planned content.
- Treat Brave Sir Knight as the baseline example for NPC behavior design.
- Route new NPC decision logic through `NPCBehavior`; do not add new direct NPC hook overrides that bypass the shared behavior contract.
- Player speech and emotes reach NPCs through the room notification methods; preserve that delivery path when changing chat or command handling.
- Keep the codebase compatible with the current threaded telnet architecture unless the roadmap says otherwise.
- If a change affects persistence, NPC brains, room triggers, or AI fallback, be careful to preserve save/load and failure-mode behavior.
- Password hashes use salted PBKDF2-SHA256; preserve verification and successful-login migration for legacy SHA-256 records until a deliberate migration removes that compatibility path.
- Do not describe the current plain Telnet connection as secure transport, even though stored password hashing has been hardened.
